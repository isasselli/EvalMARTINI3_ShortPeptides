Files associated with the manuscript entitled: Assessment of the MARTINI 3 Performance for Short Peptides Self-assembly

Folders content:

- analyses/
analysis scripts required to carry out the analysis described in the manuscript:
1. gradients analysis as described by Thallmair et al (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c03665)
2. radial distribution function (RDF) of the backbones and of the side chains
3. solvent accessible surface area (SASA), required to calculate the aggregation propensities (AP).
   AP=SASA0/SASAf. SASA0=initial SASA; SASAf=final SASA

- simulations_mdps/
mdp files with all the simulation parameters employed. Standard is the one used unless otherwise specified.
