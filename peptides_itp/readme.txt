Each folder contains:
- atomistic pdb files
- folders with coarsed grained pdb and itp files

Coarse grained files are distributed in models:
- martini 21 (E), martini22, martini3001_orgnl (original parameters), martini3001_opt, and martini3001_op2.

Martini3001_opt is the optimized parameter set. But when more than only F are optimized, these are in the opt2.
Thus, in those cases the martini3001_opt refers to v3opt*.

Additionally, when there is no difference between martini22 and martini21, only the former is used.
