Each folder contains:
- atomistic pdb files
- folders with coarsed-grained pdb and itp files

FF contains all the combinations of parameters employed in the screening. v3opt can be found at /martini3/all-Sbeads/martini3001_SC4SC4-Q4_choosen/

For the rest of the peptides, coarse-grained files are distributed in models:
- martini 21 (E), martini22, martini3001_orgnl (original parameters), martini3001_opt, and martini3001_op2.

Martini3001_opt is the optimized parameter set. But when more than only F are optimized, these are in the opt2.
Thus, in those cases, the martini3001_opt refers to v3opt*.

Additionally, when there is no difference between martini22 and martini21, only the former is used.
